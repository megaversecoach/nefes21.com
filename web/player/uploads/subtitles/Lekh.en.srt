1
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,833
Hi!

2
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,250
You all have come and I am late.

3
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,416
No problem. Let's go home and talk.

4
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,375
- Greetings, sister.
- Greetings.

5
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,750
Come here.

6
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,708
Greetings, aunt.

7
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,958
- Greetings, dear. Welcome.
- Many, many congratulations.

8
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,458
Mother, welcome her nicely.

9
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,833
Hey, so much of style and attitude.

10
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,541
Styles of rich and classy people.

11
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,666
You had said that Meena would
come earlier to attend wedding.

12
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,958
The card that you had
sent had a different name.

13
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,226
Where has the earlier one gone?

14
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,291
Why are you talking about the past?
Put something in her mouth.

15
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,083
Is it love marriage or arranged?

16
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,833
I found him. But then Nav's
mother was a mediator in between.

17
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,833
I have given five suits to aunt.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,750
You easily make deals from day one.

19
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,267
Is he the one who
used to send chits?

20
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,291
Keep quiet.
Are you trying to break my marriage?

21
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,583
Not even that one?

22
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,916
Saabi is her name. He must not be
remembering the one who gave chits.

23
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,250
You are already supporting
her and making my life difficult.

24
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,083
Have you brought duty free?

25
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,791
I forgot.

26
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,416
You just ditched and thrashed me.

27
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,416
This is not done.
I would die without you.

28
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,916
You will not die.

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,750
By now you would
have found a new girl.

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,375
No, I love you truly.

31
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,708
If you do not believe
me then Look at the outside.

32
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,726
You have not completed your studies.

33
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
Now you know English.

34
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,375
You do not know spelling
of Saabi so just wrote S.

35
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,898
If you call again henceforth then...

36
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,101
I shall complaint against
you in the police.

37
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,166
One minute, listen to me.

38
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,333
Take this, sister.

39
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,625
Gagan, take care of your sister's
dignity. Do something about him.

40
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,625
Leave that. Give me some as well.

41
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,291
Stupid. Go quickly.

42
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,500
He seems to be stubborn

43
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,666
Not at all. He is talking nonsense.

44
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,166
Who has so much time to waste?

45
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,791
In two days he will be
enjoying with someone else.

46
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,541
Tell me Raunak,

47
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,755
it has been five years since you got
married but still you have one child

48
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,125
Haven't you enjoyed?

49
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,500
She is such a big cheater.
She has come alone.

50
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,666
And did not get
brother-in-law with her.

51
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,541
We will not tease you, dear.
We can't handle our own.

52
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
Really, he did not get a leave.

53
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,101
Good, he will take care of the child

54
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,601
otherwise I would not have been able
to come to attend the wedding.

55
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,541
I came across Rajveer.

56
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,250
Which Rajveer?

57
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,583
The one who was with us in 11th std.

58
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,458
He was in love with you.

59
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,346
What is the matter?
Have you forgotten him?

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,291
She remembers everything.
She is just acting.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,875
What was he saying?

62
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:18,375
Nothing. We just greeted each other.

63
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,500
I enquired about his wellbeing
and he said everything is fine.

64
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,916
I invited him for the wedding
but he was making excuses.

65
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,517
He said that he had to
attend some other wedding.

66
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,791
I asked him to come home on the way.
He said that he would come.

67
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
Rest is your destiny.

68
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,291
Have all of them come?

69
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,583
No, Rajveer hasn't come yet.

70
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,625
- Where is he?
- She took my notebook as well.

71
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,125
Come on. Board the bus.

72
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,333
I will not come.

73
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,892
You had promised that you would buy
a cycle for me once I pass 10th std

74
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,125
and now I am in 11th.

75
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,541
I shall buy you one.
Let's go home first.

76
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,125
Where do you get cycles here?

77
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,708
You said that you will buy
me one at the time school gets over.

78
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,083
I do not believe you.
You are a liar.

79
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,583
Buy me a cycle now otherwise
I am not going home.

80
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,833
Wait, I will not spare you.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,208
I shall buy a bike for you.
Come on and get in.

82
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,625
I will tear all the books.
I will not study a word in 11th std.

83
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,750
You forcefully made
me study all night.

84
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,166
Because of you I studied so much.

85
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,850
And now you aren't
buying a cycle for me.

86
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,875
Stupid, today is the first day.

87
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,476
You have just completed 10th std and
have not done something extraordinary.

88
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,625
Come here.

89
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,351
- Good afternoon ma'am.
- Good afternoon.

90
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,125
Come, dear.
I shall buy a cycle for you.

91
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
You give me money.
You go in the van.

92
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,583
I will buy a cycle and come home.

93
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,416
I shall give you a Cheque.

94
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,666
If my mother was there she would
have given me without any hesitation.

95
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,125
I don't have a mother.

96
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,958
Hey, don't try to be smart
and emotionally blackmail me.

97
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:13,500
I shall not buy a cycle but
rickshaw for you. 10/-each fare.

98
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:19,250
Then ride it and come. Understood.

99
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,625
What do you think of yourself?

100
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,125
Come on sit down everyone.

101
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,208
Wait till I buy a cycle for you.

102
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,583
Cycle is like God to him.
Other children board the bus and go.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,166
This Prince wants a cycle.

104
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,500
Let me see how I buy cycle for you?

105
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,833
Go and unload the material.
I had ordered groceries and ration.

106
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,333
I will not go.

107
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,625
Then dare not try to
touch the biscuits and snacks.

108
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,208
I had ordered them for you.

109
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,583
Love you.

110
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,500
Give me a ride too.

111
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,333
No, I won't.

112
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,416
Look at my foolish son.

113
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,291
Even in sports period
he is riding cycle.

114
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,934
His muscles are going to ache.
And then he is going to trouble me

115
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,958
at night to massage
his legs with oil.

116
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:18,958
"He was always grounded.
But now he has started to fly high."

117
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:25,000
"When your face turned towards me."

118
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,166
What were you doing here?

119
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,375
Nothing. The sports period
got over so I thought...

120
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:45,916
"He was always grounded.
But now he has started to fly high."

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,333
"When your face turned towards me."

122
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:55,250
"I am on the threshold
of becoming crazy."

123
00:11:55,416 --> 00:12:00,125
"Your hands touched my shirt."

124
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:05,166
"Though full there was
shortage of water in sea."

125
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,750
"When your face turned towards me."

126
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,375
"Turned towards me."

127
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,750
Welcome my dear son.

128
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,500
You really did not know how to
ride the cycle and was demanding it.

129
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,875
And now you have hurt yourself.

130
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,250
Aren't you feeling ashamed?
Your son has got hurt.

131
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,625
Rather than putting bandage
you are making fun of him.

132
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,500
If my mother was alive she
would have come running to me.

133
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:24,166
Rascal... every time you blackmail
me by taking your mother's name.

134
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,851
Today if your mother was alive she
would not have spared you either.

135
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,166
She would have thrashed you hard.

136
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,625
Hey, I will not be able
to remove these stains.

137
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,291
Shall I call your aunt?

138
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,250
She would help you and put
bandage on your wounds as well.

139
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,958
Sorry, sorry... we won't call her.

140
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,541
Why should we call aunt?
Is she close to us?

141
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,125
We will not call her, dear.

142
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,291
You got scared.

143
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,500
Your aunt is good otherwise.

144
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,916
Here eat this.

145
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,851
- The almonds were delicious.
- Almonds are never delicious.

146
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,833
Hey, why are you sitting here?

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,958
Get up. Go and sit on your place.

148
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,541
The places are not fixed.
You go and sit in the front.

149
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,791
What are you talking?
I sit here every day.

150
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,583
You go and sit on your place.

151
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,291
Please let me sit here.

152
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,083
I haven't done my homework.

153
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,416
The teacher would come
and catch hold of me.

154
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,383
It is intelligent people
who sit in the front.

155
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,625
Get up, buddy.

156
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,208
Good morning, ma'am.

157
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,958
Good morning.

158
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,625
Those students who have not done their
homework, get up and stand aside.

159
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,708
Now we will have
to go and stand behind.

160
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,291
Will you make this diagram for me?

161
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,125
Yes, I will make it.

162
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,333
Very good.

163
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,916
Rajveer, even you have
become a part of them.

164
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,625
"Flowers have their own fragrance."

165
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,625
"But you are very unique."

166
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,041
"But you are very unique."

167
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,125
"I am mad, crazy,
lover, Majnu, Ranjha of yours."

168
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,625
"You will show me heaven and make me
meet God. My heart tells me this."

169
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,666
"I had no intention of
prostrating in front of you."

170
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,083
"I did not have much faith on God."

171
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,333
"Not much faith."

172
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:36,541
"After connecting with
you I connected with God."

173
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:41,500
"When your face turned towards me."

174
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,583
"Turned towards me."

175
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:11,291
"My remaining breaths
are for you, dear."

176
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:16,083
"You have to intoxicate
me with your eyes, dear."

177
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,666
"I walk along with
you as your shadow."

178
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,416
"I will take care
of you as a child."

179
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,458
"Your style and attitude
is such that I got trapped"

180
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:35,041
"On seeing you dear
even water drowned."

181
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:40,250
"On seeing you even water drowned."

182
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,666
"When your face turned towards me."

183
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:50,875
"I am on the threshold
of becoming crazy."

184
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:55,541
"Your hands touched my shirt."

185
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,375
Oh my God.

186
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,125
My cycle got punctured.

187
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,708
Sit down.

188
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,833
Where is your cycle?

189
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,291
My cycle got punctured.

190
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,166
What have you brought in lunch box?

191
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,500
Potato and cauliflower.

192
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,103
Even I have brought
cauliflower pickle.

193
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,416
Is there a cauliflower
pickle as well?

194
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Yes, it is there.

195
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,708
It must be something else.
You do not know anything.

196
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,208
It is of cauliflower. I shall
make you taste in the recess.

197
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,166
My aunt makes such pickles.

198
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,583
That of carrot,
radish, gourd and ginger.

199
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,351
She knows how to put
various kinds of pickles.

200
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,500
Okay, then at lunchtime.

201
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,208
Okay, then at lunchtime.

202
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,250
What?

203
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,416
You go and sit there.

204
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,750
We just have gooseberry, chili,
lemon and ginger plants in our house.

205
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,125
Only four type of pickles are made.

206
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,375
My aunt makes six
types of lemon pickle.

207
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,458
One is sweet,
one is of black pepper and salt.

208
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,416
One is simple.
The sweet one is very delicious.

209
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,333
Hey, who teaches
you to talk so sweetly?

210
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,041
Rajveer, not a brad but
a nail seems to be pierced.

211
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,476
Then you will have to put a new tube.
We are not going to spend so much money.

212
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,958
I will go by van.

213
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,875
No, no there is only one puncture.

214
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,833
Why have you come, sister-in-law?

215
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
- Hey, Charan.
- Yes.

216
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,166
Shouldn't you get married
so that your house is settled?

217
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,708
Show me the girl's photo first.

218
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Will she get motorcycle for me?

219
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,583
Did you listen?

220
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,000
Do buffaloes get satisfied
by drinking water?

221
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,958
Shameless.
How dare you demand a motorcycle?

222
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:30,250
I was saying that I am going
to get my son Manga married.

223
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,000
You are unmarried and
your son is young too.

224
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,916
And I would not let you
stare at my daughter-in-law.

225
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,791
I was suggesting that
you give this house to me

226
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,625
and you go and stay somewhere else.

227
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,333
You go and stay somewhere else.
We will not sell it.

228
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,333
What is the problem?
Take money and leave.

229
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,541
We will stay here.

230
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
Sister-in-law,
why do you worry unnecessarily?

231
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,958
Why shouldn't I worry?

232
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,083
Do you think I will let
you stare at my daughter-in-law?

233
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,333
I will not let that happen.

234
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,041
I would make a wall as
tall as 20 feet in the middle.

235
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,166
I shall not even let you
hear the sound of her anklets.

236
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,541
I was saying for your benefit.
Father and son both are loafers.

237
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,875
At least respect what
the other person is suggesting.

238
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,708
Shouldn't we make
Rajveer as sarwala?

239
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,708
Say something better.

240
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,625
Then make Charan.

241
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,916
To hell with you.

242
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,166
Oh my God.

243
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,767
Are you serious of
getting married again?

244
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,666
No, dear. Who knows whether the new
bride would have a sister or not?

245
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,916
Your aunt loves me a lot.

246
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,083
"I will keep dancing as
she loves her brother-in-law."

247
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,458
Catch you.

248
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,000
Don't behave like a fool.

249
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:00,166
Don't cry, my dear son.

250
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,458
God bless us.

251
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,041
The cycle got punctured again.

252
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,476
You just got it
repaired the other day.

253
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
See for yourself.

254
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,208
It makes my mood bad.

255
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,000
I think the cycle is not
of good quality. We will sell it.

256
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,684
I am feeling very bad that you're
hard earned money is going waste.

257
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,333
Really? You seemed to be
very worried about my hard work.

258
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,583
You were adamant and
stubborn on getting a cycle.

259
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,026
You should have bought a good one.

260
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,803
You seemed to have
bought a cheaper quality.

261
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,166
First day it broke down.
How will it last?

262
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,392
Why are you staring at me?

263
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,017
Is the puncture going to be fixed
with your eyes?

264
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,521
Come on let's go.
We are getting late.

265
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,916
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes.

266
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,458
Chutney is made from mango,
mint, lemon

267
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,625
my aunt knows how to
make many kinds of chutney.

268
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,250
Sweet mango chutney is my favorite.

269
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,583
My aunt knows how to
make many kinds of chutney.

270
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,666
She is in Aanganwadi. She teaches
other girls of the village as well.

271
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,208
You tell me how to make
of mango and lemon.

272
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,500
I will also make.

273
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,708
I will arrange your meeting
with her. You can learn all of them.

274
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,267
- Okay fine.
- Aunt will appreciate you a lot.

275
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,791
Hey, get up.

276
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,041
This is my place.
Don't you understand?

277
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,791
I am sitting on your place.

278
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,208
It is our van.

279
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:59,291
Uncle, shall we start going
in another van from tomorrow?

280
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,416
Get up. Go dear,
you go and sit there.

281
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,583
Come and sit here.

282
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,291
-What? -Don't you understand
that he is trying to woo you?

283
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,833
Teaching you how to make chutneys?

284
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,878
She is a very nice cow. Look she has
given birth to such a beautiful calf.

285
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,583
Go and deliver milk today.

286
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,125
What will we name her, father?

287
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,791
Who gives name to them?

288
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,875
It's done.

289
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,208
Be careful while repairing it.
It is the third time.

290
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,083
I will name her Raunak.

291
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:03,916
Okay!

292
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,892
Every day it gets punctured
at a different place.

293
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,601
I think there seems
to be nails in the compound.

294
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,000
I think people's evil
eye has fallen on it.

295
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,791
Everyone seems to be jealous.

296
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,250
God bless us. Bless us

297
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,125
He will ask me to change the tube.
Then dad will think about this.

298
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,083
Every day I will pierce you.

299
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey, idiot. I will not spare you.

300
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,208
Rather than repairing
the cycle I will thrash you.

301
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,458
Don't hit me. My knees pain
so I am not able to ride the cycle.

302
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,416
My thighs hurt as well.

303
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,791
You take me in van
and sell this cycle.

304
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,458
I will never ask
for it again. Sorry.

305
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,767
Why did you ask me to buy it then?

306
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,125
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

307
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:14,666
Listen to what your aunt and I say.

308
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,083
Don't waste your time on cycling.

309
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,458
Study well and win great awards.

310
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,250
It is every day's matter now.

311
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,958
Why don't you do your homework?

312
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,416
You do not understand
when I talk to you lovingly.

313
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,791
He has got fit.
Now a case will be filed.

314
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,916
Stupid. Make him sit on the chair.

315
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,416
What happened to you, dear?

316
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,041
Remove your tie.

317
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,500
Look, what have you done?

318
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,416
Did he become unconscious
because of my slap?

319
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,791
Only he seems to be affected.
Rest all are laughing.

320
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,166
He has some special
feelings for you.

321
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,000
He is going to be thrashed
and will involve you as well.

322
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,559
You only seemed to be interested
in asking him how chutneys are made.

323
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,708
Give some water.

324
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,333
Where are you going?

325
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,291
To give him water.

326
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,625
Do you want to kill him?

327
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,267
All this is happening
because you touched him.

328
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,731
And after drinking water from
your bottle he would surely die.

329
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,125
You know Lalli very well.

330
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,041
He was very small
when his mother expired.

331
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,458
But he still misses her.

332
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,791
After being thrashed by the girl he
must be missing his mother's thrashing.

333
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,291
I try to make him
happy as much as I can

334
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,135
but no one can take
the position of a mother.

335
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,041
I hope there is nothing
to worry, doctor.

336
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,541
Rajveer,
go and get a glass of water.

337
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,500
Your son is becoming young.

338
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,875
I think he seems to be
getting involved with a girl.

339
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,708
Hormones change in this age.

340
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,333
Oh God, what has happened to him?

341
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,208
That is why he pierced
the cycle again and again.

342
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,250
I am sure the girl is in the van.

343
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,416
Now I have to worry about him.

344
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,750
He is still a kid in his
behavior but has become a lover.

345
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,500
I do not know how to
talk to him about this matter.

346
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,250
Let me call her aunt here.
Women know how to deal such matters.

347
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,375
Take one more.

348
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,750
- No, enough.
- Have it.

349
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,125
You are becoming
weak so you should eat.

350
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,250
Don't you take care of the girl?

351
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,309
He does not have time
from his whims and fancies.

352
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,053
Don't you see that
his small finger is hurt?

353
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,375
"I want to tell
how much I love you."

354
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,916
Look at his condition in love.

355
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,125
Raj...

356
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,291
Aunt.

357
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,458
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings.

358
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,166
- Greetings, aunt.
- Greetings.

359
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,500
When did you come?

360
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,333
You do not even miss your aunt now?

361
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,875
Only my brother-in-law invites me.

362
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Eat it.

363
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,250
No, I don't want to.

364
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,333
Come on you eat one more.

365
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,250
- No, enough.
- Eat it.

366
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,750
He has fallen in love.

367
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,875
I can't talk to him but you
explain in your own way to him.

368
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:52,958
Are you lying?

369
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,125
No, I am saying the truth.

370
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,291
- His heart has started beating fast.
- I see.

371
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,291
Go and get cottage cheese.

372
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,041
I love when your aunt cooks it.

373
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,833
Uncle is useless and coward.

374
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,708
What is her name?

375
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,041
Whose?

376
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,750
Okay, whose?

377
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,642
Because of whom your
heart has become restless.

378
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:22,226
Brother-in-law called me here
to explain and make you understand.

379
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,458
He is a liar.

380
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:27,500
I am just an excuse but the
truth is that he misses you a lot.

381
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,476
And you are so innocent that
you are making cottage cheese here.

382
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,125
And uncle who does not speak
anything. He does not feel anything.

383
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,625
He is your uncle.

384
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,333
And I could easily judge
from the song that you were singing.

385
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:44,416
"Today we will spend night together
and I wish the day does not break."

386
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,875
What does this song signify now?

387
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:51,166
Tonight would be fun when
we sit together and enjoy.

388
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,450
You are right, brother-in-law.

389
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,559
He would make him drink
more so that he sleeps.

390
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,726
And then he will chit chat with you.

391
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,500
Today I will not let you sleep,
brother-in-law.

392
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,000
He is just joking, stupid.

393
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,083
I did love marriage.

394
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,875
Your uncles are
still annoyed with me

395
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,517
and he is the one who has
kept cordial relations with me.

396
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,833
Your uncle used to
boast and now does nothing.

397
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,375
I am a part of Aanganwadi
and that is how our house runs.

398
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,601
My sister got married where
the family members asked her to do.

399
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,666
She was lucky to have your father.

400
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,041
Till she was alive

401
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,142
your father loved and respected
her and treated her like a queen.

402
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,766
Is he was like him then long back
he would have got married again.

403
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,000
If you want to do love marriage
then do not do haste like uncle.

404
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,791
First pay attention to studies.
You should not get less marks.

405
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,531
And when the time is right
I will take care of everything.

406
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,333
Okay, now tell me her name at least.

407
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:42,958
Raunak.

408
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:47,500
Wow! There would be fun
and frolic in my sister's house.

409
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,708
Why hasn't she come today?

410
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,976
She is not going to come for 3-4 days.
She has gone to attend a wedding.

411
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,083
- She always has fun.
- How are you Raunak, dear?

412
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,583
I am fine uncle? How are you?

413
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,500
I am fine too.
How are your studies going on?

414
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:12,583
It is going on well.

415
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,666
Very good.

416
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,458
Did my son say something?

417
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,958
Tell me if he says something.
Alright.

418
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,333
Take this chocolate.

419
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,875
- Thank you, uncle.
- Good girl.

420
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,291
Why did he give chocolate to you?

421
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:32,500
The boy is trying to woo and father
also has father-in-law type feelings.

422
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,416
Throw away. Do not eat it, dear.

423
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,958
He is trying to impress
by giving chocolate worth 5/-

424
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,583
Come and tell me.
Why will I tell you?

425
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,966
We will directly go
to the principal's office.

426
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,416
Oh no, I ate it.

427
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,916
Maybe he has done some sort
of magic. Thank God you are saved.

428
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,125
- Did you do your work?
- No.

429
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,125
- Why didn't you do it?
- Raunak.

430
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:13,708
For you.

431
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,833
So at last you did it.

432
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,083
I very well knew your traits.

433
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,708
I did not mean that.

434
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,333
I am sorry, please do not feel bad.

435
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,976
Why are you apologizing now? Now
I will complain to the principal.

436
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,416
- Let's go Raunak.
- No, no.

437
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,666
It is not for love.
It is for friendship.

438
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,125
Look at its color.

439
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,375
It is yellow.

440
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,041
Don't change the topic.

441
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,892
I very well know what
colors you want to give.

442
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,625
Let's go from here, Raunak.

443
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,541
Where did you pluck it from?

444
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,166
- What?
- Where did you pluck it from?

445
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,291
Apologize. Apologize now.

446
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:55,583
Sorry.

447
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,375
Do not apologize to me but to this.

448
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,166
Why did you pluck the flower?

449
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,666
Okay, sorry.

450
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,583
Sorry.

451
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,708
Sorry.

452
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,875
Even they feel the
same pain as we feel.

453
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,333
What kind of pain?

454
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,625
Look now you are fluttering in pain.
Shall I break your ear?

455
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:06,208
"My dear, beloved
Your sight is appealing to me."

456
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:11,833
"My dear, beloved
Your sight is appealing to me."

457
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:19,916
"I just don't love you but
I am passionately in love with you."

458
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:29,250
"I bow to you but are
scared of you as well."

459
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:35,125
"I just don't love you but
I am passionately in love with you."

460
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,250
"Talking to you seems
As if I am talking to God."

461
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:12,458
"Even children of your
neighborhood have become poets."

462
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:18,500
"Secretly you have
become my weakness."

463
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:24,166
"You are even above God.
You are someone different."

464
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:30,041
"You are like me and I am like you."

465
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:38,125
"I just don't love you but
I am passionately in love with you."

466
00:37:56,458 --> 00:38:02,208
"Every day I think
whom will I trouble"

467
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:08,041
"If anything happens to
you then where shall I go?"

468
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:13,791
"Every day I think
whom will I trouble"

469
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:18,958
"If anything happens to
you then where shall I go?"

470
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:24,875
"You take care of
yourself at any cost."

471
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:30,750
"I am the solution to all your
problems. Keep me close to you."

472
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,541
"I will be the one standing for
you where no one stands for you."

473
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:44,625
"I just don't love you but
I am passionately in love with you."

474
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,625
Saabi, Rajveer has come.

475
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,375
I asked him to sit here.

476
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,333
Did you tell him
that Raunak has come?

477
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:09,541
Yes.

478
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:10,666
That is the reason.

479
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,393
Movie Mel Karade Rabba is going
to release in my uncle's theatre.

480
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,500
I want to watch that movie.

481
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,546
Family members are not
going to allow me though.

482
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,875
Jimmy Shergill's name
is Rajveer in the movie.

483
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:14,875
Yes.

484
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,791
You don't feel so happy.

485
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,041
It is Gippi Grewal
who would take Neeru Bajwa.

486
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:23,125
That is in the movie but
here only Rajveer will take.

487
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,458
Jimmy Shergill is looking
so handsome in the trailer.

488
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,791
Before me God did not
let your affair happen anywhere

489
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,833
and now I will not let it happen.

490
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:40,416
If I can break others limbs then
can also break other's relations.

491
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:43,708
You are too good.

492
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,000
- Pamma.
- Yes.

493
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,900
Will you cut my hair in this style?

494
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Wow!

495
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,125
Sin Theta, Main Theta

496
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,666
This photograph is lying down
your Main Theta, your aunt.

497
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,666
This is what you are studying.

498
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,333
There is no need to study, dear.

499
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,375
You will be then driving this van
and taking kids to school.

500
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,708
I bought it by mistake, father.

501
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,208
Couldn't you get
a photo of a patriotic?

502
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,208
This is what is happening?

503
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,250
This is the way you are studying.

504
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,708
Don't think yourself to be a Mirza.

505
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,958
She is the age of your aunt.

506
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,166
At least you could
have put my photograph.

507
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,958
Don't I look good?

508
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,083
It was Fine arts project, father.

509
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,458
Fine arts project, father?

510
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:00,291
I know you very well, dear.

511
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,666
I was thinking that
my son is getting patriotic

512
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,625
after seeing you wearing army jacket
and having army haircut.

513
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,916
My son is brave.
But you are copying your uncle.

514
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:16,500
Give me all these
and I will burn them.

515
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,791
Don't do that, father.
I will drink spray.

516
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,250
Till today I have
not said anything to you

517
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,896
but if you say such a thing
again then I shall thrash you hard.

518
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,916
Come on do whatever you wish to.

519
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,041
I shall call your Aunty

520
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,083
and then even I will
be able to pass time.

521
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,833
Study hard.

522
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,375
If you do not get good numbers
then will make you artist as well.

523
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,041
Thank God,
father did not see this photo.

524
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,125
Will you come with me
to watch Mel Karade Rabba?

525
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:20,625
Yes. But still there is time.
Let us first pass.

526
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,916
We will go after the
papers by bunking school.

527
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,208
What if we are caught?

528
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,958
We will not get caught.

529
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:28,958
- Sure?
- Yes.

530
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,750
Sure but do not tell
anyone about this.

531
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,125
Let's go.

532
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,250
What was he saying?

533
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,333
Nothing.

534
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,708
Look at him.
He feels as if he is Jimmy Shergill.

535
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,833
Yes.

536
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,083
One ticket costs 35/-
so two will cost 70/-

537
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:06,166
Cold drink for 10/- each.
70/- and 20/- totals to 90/-

538
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,416
Study first.

539
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,666
Two samosas for 15/-

540
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:14,750
90 and 15/- totals to 105/-...
everything will be done in 120-125/-

541
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:19,583
Study first. There is still much time.
You can do calculations in holidays.

542
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,916
I shall give you my share
of money tomorrow.

543
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,708
'The special distance they
are not visible in...'

544
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,416
We have to eat popcorn as well.
So it will cost 150/-

545
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,333
Okay we will not eat popcorn.

546
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,166
You really resemble
Jimmy Shergill somewhat.

547
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,208
What nonsense? Jimmy has a style.

548
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:41,000
On looking at him it feels
as if he just shaved off his hair.

549
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:44,708
Move there.

550
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,041
- What?
- You study.

551
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,166
I haven't studied. Have you?

552
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,625
All the best.

553
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,625
This is from me.

554
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:36,250
What if someone sees
us in school uniform?

555
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,791
We will not go in uniform.
You get suit in the bag.

556
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,500
No.

557
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,666
I will get caught. I can't do this.

558
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,208
Do you know how many family
members are there in my house?

559
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,416
Silence class.

560
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,541
Do you know the answers?

561
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:07,416
I will get my mother's suit.
You can try that.

562
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,541
Okay.

563
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,625
It is slightly lose but I
will get it altered from the tailor.

564
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,750
No.

565
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:55,625
It is your mother's
so will not get it altered.

566
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,875
Let it be the way it is.

567
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,625
The veil covers everything.

568
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:15,458
"Your destiny brought you together"

569
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:20,666
"And with dive blessings"

570
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:25,875
"Your destiny is together."

571
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:29,333
"Always remember His name."

572
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,208
Dear, why did you
get down here today?

573
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,833
Uncle, my van's driver
stays in this house.

574
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,708
For last so many days instead
of him someone else is coming.

575
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,125
You ask him.

576
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,309
Nothing is certain
about these people.

577
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,708
Wherever they get more
money they start working there.

578
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:47,708
He must have got
work somewhere else.

579
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:50,083
Don't think so much.

580
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,875
Come, my dear.

581
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,833
Come.

582
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,708
Do meet me before leaving.

583
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,041
Yes, surely I will try.

584
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,083
Even you meet me.

585
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,625
We'll meet then.

586
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,041
- Okay aunty, see you soon.
- Okay.

587
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,625
- Take this as token.
- What is this for?

588
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,017
- No problem, dear.
- You have already give me suit, aunty.

589
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,958
No problem, dear.
This is an auspicious token.

590
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,041
- Okay uncle.
- Bye dear.

591
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,500
- Okay, sister. See you soon.
- Okay.

592
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,875
Let's go.

593
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,250
Bye.

594
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,125
- Greetings.
- Greetings, dear.

595
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,750
What is the condition of the garden?

596
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:20,583
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, dear

597
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,833
- Can't you do this much?
- Greetings, sister.

598
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,625
Can't you just turn on the tap?

599
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:27,541
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, dear

600
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,500
- Greetings, father.
- Greetings, dear

601
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,333
Couldn't you take care of them?

602
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,250
They too have life in them.

603
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,375
You have killed them of thirst.

604
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,583
No problem, dear.

605
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,041
Now do not hang us for this mistake.

606
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,875
Don't play jokes.

607
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,416
Forgive us, dear.

608
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,125
We shall get more plants
from nursery tomorrow.

609
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,416
And will give permanent
duty to them. Rest we are there.

610
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,041
Dear, have some patience.

611
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,208
Let me grind it well.

612
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,916
Aunt, let me eat like this.

613
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,791
Sister, new plants have come.

614
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:02,875
Really?

615
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:30,958
Tell me dear.

616
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,625
Where do you want plant these ones?

617
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,416
Greetings.

618
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,416
I shall put whichever
plants you tell me to plant.

619
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,833
Marigold, Rose, Mogra Sunflower,
marigold, Bougainville, Champa, daisy,

620
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:19,166
Lily, lajwanti,
jasmine, sunflower,

621
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,416
Lily, demnia, Mangolai, saffron...

622
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,750
We do not want to know their names.

623
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,958
Just tell which ones
should be panted where.

624
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,208
Okay.

625
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,000
These are evergreen and
are to be planted only once.

626
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:49,333
And in this bed of soil
we will plant something else.

627
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,250
That you will have to change
after 6 months according to season.

628
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:57,833
She has started crying
seeing so many plants.

629
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:59,458
This is her condition.

630
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,541
Will we have to plant that again?

631
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,250
Yes you will have to do that.

632
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,083
Some are evergreen.

633
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,583
If they bloom once
they bloom forever.

634
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:09,833
Some change like season.

635
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:17,916
"The one for whom
I waited for ages crying"

636
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:31,875
"When I found my beloved
she belonged to someone else."

637
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:45,208
"Congratulate me, will celebrate
if you come to my house tonight."

638
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,958
"Ask any heartbroken
poet to recite his poems."

639
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:52,291
"Recite poems on my death."

640
01:01:54,583 --> 01:02:01,541
"Heer belonged to Raanjha
but someone else snatched her away."

641
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:09,625
"When I found my beloved
she belonged to someone else."

642
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:38,375
"I maybe was cheated"

643
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:43,208
"but till today I love you."

644
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:48,708
"If it is not you
then the story is over."

645
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:53,000
"I am about to die."

646
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:59,583
"With my tears I have
washed away my pain."

647
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:06,750
"The one for whom
I waited for ages crying"

648
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:14,833
"When I found my beloved
she belonged to someone else."

649
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,541
- Okay, uncle. Come to meet me.
- Okay dear, take care.

650
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,958
- Give lots of love to Manindar.
- Sure.

651
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,458
Leave it.

652
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,541
- Take care sister.
- Okay bye.

653
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,958
Hello Saabi.

654
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:54,125
Dear, I would suggest
not to unwind the past.

655
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,458
You will be hurt.

656
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:59,583
And if nothing is figured
out then it would create chaos.

657
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,208
You have done nothing.

658
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,875
I have left so many boys
and have never looked back at them.

659
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,625
What have we to do with him?

660
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:10,166
And if his wife is bad
then she would insult you.

661
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,333
And will talk in insulting tone.

662
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:13,791
Rest is your wish.

663
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,875
Don't worry.
I am not thinking on those lines.

664
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:20,000
I will call you and
then you come to pick me up.

665
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,666
It does not happen this way.

666
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,851
You did not water them for 5 days and
then next day you watered it too much.

667
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,166
You have to timely take care of it.
Consider plants as children.

668
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,791
Will it be fine if we do not eat for
few days and then eat lots one day?

669
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,396
They do not ask for anything special.

670
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,791
Whatever is there in
your house is enough for them.

671
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:01,375
No problem, let's be satisfied
with the remaining ones.

672
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,625
Do one thing.

673
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:09,000
You take only four.
It will be easy to handle.

674
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,750
And once you learn to handle
them then you can take more.

675
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:16,166
Its cost was 900/-
but now give only 500/-

676
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,583
Take the remaining later
once you learn to handle them.

677
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,750
Take it.

678
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,500
Okay fine.

679
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,291
What happened?
Do you need something else?

680
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:54,583
Have the plants got spoiled?

681
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,625
Do only customers
come in this house?

682
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,208
No.

683
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,833
How are you?

684
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:05,875
I am good.

685
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,625
Is uncle at home?

686
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:13,833
No.

687
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,250
Where is he?

688
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,208
He is no more.

689
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,500
Sorry, I didn't know that.

690
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:24,625
No problem.

691
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,041
When did this happen?

692
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,291
Long back.

693
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,541
Who is there at home?

694
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
No one.

695
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,083
Wife?

696
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,416
I am still single.

697
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,791
Haven't you got married yet?

698
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,291
I am still single.

699
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:42,541
But why?

700
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,208
I did not fine a nice girl.

701
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,309
How is it possible that
you did not get a nice girl?

702
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,500
If you could not find one but I am
sure uncle would have found one for you.

703
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,950
Didn't you get one or you
did not get married willingly?

704
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,708
I am trying to find one.

705
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,541
When I find her then
I will invite you.

706
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,791
Will you have water?

707
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,291
Tea or coffee?

708
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,125
Coffee is fine.

709
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,500
I shall get coffee.

710
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,416
Have a seat.

711
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:42,916
"I had thought that when
you would come you would hug me"

712
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
"make me yours and love me."

713
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:51,708
"I thought you would look into
my eyes and not look away from them"

714
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:55,583
"You will enquire about
me and kiss my forehead."

715
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:59,625
"I had thought that
you would make me meet God"

716
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:03,083
"But had no idea that
you would make me see hell."

717
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:07,166
"I had thought you stay with me,
be loyal"

718
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:11,041
"and seeing me crying
you too will cry."

719
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:43,750
What enmity do you have
with me that you cannot talk?

720
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:56,083
Okay if you don't wish
to talk then I will leave.

721
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,291
- Hello.
- Yes, Raunak.

722
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,000
- Speak up...
- I will call later.

723
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,375
I think she has invited trouble.

724
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,083
Yes.

725
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,500
She was newly married.

726
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,708
I think she left the house
on boyfriend's insistence

727
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:38,833
and now he must not
be receiving her calls.

728
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,416
Now she is just roaming
around aimlessly.

729
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,291
This is not possible that in all
these years you could not find a girl.

730
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:56,041
I did not find one.

731
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,083
Are you angry with
me for some reason?

732
01:10:58,875 --> 01:10:59,875
No.

733
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,125
Stop it.
I don't want to have coffee.

734
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:24,166
I waited for you Rajveer.

735
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:31,750
For one year.

736
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,375
Each day...

737
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,583
absent, absent.

738
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:40,958
Absent.

739
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:45,041
Earlier I did not
feel much difference.

740
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:50,208
What is the difference
between you and classmates

741
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,125
I realized it after you left.

742
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,291
Then I found out from the college...

743
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,375
you are not living in this village.

744
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:05,875
Then college got over
and family found a boy for me.

745
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12,833
He is nice, very nice.

746
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,541
You disappeared and
then was never found.

747
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:21,333
But God blessed me
with another Rajveer.

748
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:28,916
He is one year old now.
Everything is fine now.

749
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:34,416
Photo.

750
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:46,916
He is so cute.
I am in comparison to him.

751
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,250
This is done. I shall add milk to it.
I'll be back.

752
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:03,583
"Without you every
night was dark for me."

753
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:07,000
"The world laughed at me on my face."

754
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,375
"I am happy that you
are happy but to be honest"

755
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:14,000
"I am sad that you
have settled in life."

756
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:19,625
"From the time you got separated"

757
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:22,750
"I have not sleep."

758
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:29,583
"The one for whom
I waited for ages crying"

759
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:36,500
"When I found my beloved
she belonged to someone else."

760
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,791
Why didn't you come back, Rajveer?

761
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,875
I have moved ahead in my life.

762
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,416
It has been 10 years.

763
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:00,500
But this question still
awaked me from sleep.

764
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:04,083
That why didn't you come back?

765
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,333
What had happened?

766
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,750
After father's death I was taken to
Rajasthan to my grandparents' house.

767
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:23,708
For 6-7 months I did not understand
that what has happened with me.

768
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:27,250
I could not believe
that I have lost my father.

769
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,291
He was the only love close to me.

770
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,041
And he too left.

771
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,166
After him it was
only you whom I loved.

772
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,458
I had thought I would fall at your
feet but will surely convince you.

773
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:55,833
I would tell you how lonely I am.

774
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,333
Raunak, I had come

775
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,125
on 14th February 2012

776
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,208
You did not feel necessary
to at least talk to me.

777
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,601
Just seeing that from a
distance you judged everything.

778
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,291
I had no other option.

779
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,541
I had still come to talk to you.

780
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,666
I had come on your wedding as well.

781
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,958
- Kamal.
- Greetings, uncle.

782
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,000
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

783
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:38,458
You alone are not
going to leave the house.

784
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:41,125
We have bought property.

785
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,583
We will also be leaving
village and moving there.

786
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,583
We have to make garden
in the new house, dear.

787
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:49,125
Don't be sad. Okay.

788
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,500
Stay happy.

789
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:08,750
That boy was also present there.
I felt very bad and mean.

790
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,875
You were someone else's happiness

791
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,333
but I felt your sadness
was also someone else's.

792
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,083
I was nowhere.

793
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:18,541
Now she has got married
and next number is mine.

794
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:22,333
How is that beautiful
girl next to sister-in-law?

795
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,916
That day I got very angry
on God and my on my destiny.

796
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:56,250
And on that boy and the most on you.

797
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,625
You had faith on a very wrong boy.

798
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,208
I had no connection with that boy.

799
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:10,291
But he liked Saabi.

800
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:14,416
He was her boyfriend.

801
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:43,625
That is why in my marriage
he was asking about her.

802
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,791
You should have
at least talked to me.

803
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:34,416
Do you remember that last day?

804
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,000
How can anyone forget that moment?

805
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:45,708
I thought everything
will get over with time.

806
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:51,208
You thought I was that seasonal
plant which changed with time.

807
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:55,166
And you are that plant which if
bloomed would remain bloomed forever.

808
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,458
No, nothing of that sort.

809
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:01,958
Whatever had to happen has happened.

810
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:04,333
I have also moved ahead in life.

811
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,166
Everything is normal now.

812
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:10,583
Initially I felt but we are not
kids anymore that we cry all life.

813
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:14,250
No one gives me a girl
seeing that I am alone.

814
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:17,625
Don't think that I remained
unmarried because of you.

815
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,208
Now there is no love
in my heart towards you

816
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,666
the anger has been vent out.

817
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:29,500
Today I have realized
that I am such a big fool.

818
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,416
I feel like laughing
and getting angry on myself.

819
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,750
No problem.

820
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,625
Bygones are bygones now.

821
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,916
Good that you came.

822
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:44,583
Rajveer, give me one kg milk.

823
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:58,250
They left the milk out
and the cat spilled the milk.

824
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,666
I will get it, aunt.

825
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:13,166
Raunak, Raunak.

826
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,750
Where are you looking?
Why don't you speak?

827
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,250
Yes.

828
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:23,875
I did not say anything to you.
I was teasing Raunak.

829
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,541
He has kept her name Raunak.
He is a fool.

830
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,291
The entire day he keeps
calling and talking to her.

831
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:32,625
Who are you?

832
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:34,708
- I am...
- She is my friend.

833
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,000
She has come to meet me.
We studied together in school.

834
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:40,833
Is she your friend or girlfriend?

835
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,041
Girlfriend.

836
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,500
What?

837
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,125
Are you married or unmarried?

838
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,291
I am married.

839
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,000
Doesn't your husband
have any objection?

840
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:50,041
I did not tell my husband
before coming here.

841
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,291
This is great.
You shall go after few days.

842
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,291
Why would he get married?

843
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:59,666
No, no I will not go now.
Now I will be here.

844
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:01,541
I ran away from home.

845
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:04,761
You are enjoying but she is going
to spread this news in the village.

846
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:10,916
Rascal, you enjoy
but don't let us enjoy.

847
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:15,625
And what were you doing in
the bus in which you were sitting.

848
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,833
Aunt, there is nothing of this sort.

849
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,958
Don't tell anyone about
this in the village.

850
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,833
Are you crazy?

851
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,166
She is very clever. She is going
to tell everyone in the village.

852
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:31,541
You were saying everything is fine.

853
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,833
What is her name?

854
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:38,000
When she was born we were
in school and that time I named her.

855
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:41,041
Really, find a girl for
me and I shall get married today.

856
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,291
Find a mediator and get me married.

857
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:46,125
Everything is fine.
There is a time...

858
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,875
Saabi also got married otherwise
I would have married her.

859
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,791
We got along well.

860
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,375
Sorry, sorry...

861
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,708
- Hello.
- Come and pick me up.

862
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,000
I know you are totally crazy.

863
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:58,083
How will I leave
home in this late night?

864
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:01,458
I have just got married
and you know my record very well.

865
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,750
Call Kamal.

866
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:05,041
Except for you no
one else knows anything.

867
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:06,916
Then ask him to
drop you at the hotel.

868
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,291
Will you drop me at the hotel?

869
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,291
Why do you want to go to hotel?

870
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,125
Stay here.

871
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:59,083
Mange, Mange.

872
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,041
Come here.

873
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:16,583
Look they are having
candle light dinner.

874
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:23,000
Go quietly and get milk.

875
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,958
You take drinks so go and get it.

876
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:30,625
We will put bites
into each other's mouth.

877
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:35,250
First get and then
I will put into nostrils.

878
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:40,625
You just don't do anything
but just make plans and schemes.

879
01:29:42,916 --> 01:29:45,197
Today after so many years
I have had food whole heartedly.

880
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,125
What does R2 mean?

881
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:35,041
Rajveer and Raunak.

882
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,708
The name of your cow is also Raunak.

883
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:42,416
I like plants and
you made them your life.

884
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:48,625
After I left no girl
came in your life.

885
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:55,416
It is your misunderstanding
that I don't know anything.

886
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:00,875
I have understood everything.

887
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:06,041
That you are such a plant that once
blooms will always remain blooming.

888
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,166
No season has an effect on it.

889
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:15,958
You boys once commit
then do not listen to anyone.

890
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:19,583
You are a true lover.

891
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,583
But we girls cannot remain committed.

892
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,750
Parents cannot keep us at home.

893
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,750
It is our destiny

894
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,697
to leave our parents' house
and go to our husband's house.

895
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,750
We girls are those
plants that are forced

896
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:46,458
to change with season and weather.

897
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:08,041
Is this the same suit that
I was supposed to wear for the film?

898
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,791
Yes.

899
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,875
In that movie with whom
does Neeru Bajwa go in the end?

900
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,000
With Jimmy Shergill.

901
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,041
Did you watch the movie?

902
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:20,833
Tell me the story.

903
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:22,750
I haven't seen the movie.

904
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:25,666
You?

905
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:48,208
How are you Kamal?

906
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:49,416
I am fine.

907
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,250
Does your uncle's
theatre still there?

908
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:53,458
Yes.

909
01:33:04,916 --> 01:33:06,666
We have come here to watch a movie.

910
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,916
Movies that are released
here are not worth watching.

911
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,166
We will still watch a movie.

912
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:13,666
You are doing wrong.

913
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,916
Don't park the motorcycle here.
Park it there.

914
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:38,458
We had to see 'Mel Kara De Rabba.' That
does not mean we will see this movie.

915
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:41,416
This is a dirty movie.
Didn't you see the poster outside?

916
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:14,541
"Give me my light
Even God requests for that."

917
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:19,875
"The moon walks on your terrace
and does not shine in the sky."

918
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:25,333
"I shall get all
the stars at your feet."

919
01:34:25,416 --> 01:34:30,583
"The moon walks on your terrace
and does not shine in the sky."

920
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:35,916
"It is not scare of wind
And not bothered about water."

921
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,291
"It does not even listen to clouds
And is totally careless."

922
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:49,375
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

923
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:52,041
"Became disloyal."

924
01:34:52,125 --> 01:35:00,125
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

925
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:03,208
"Became disloyal."

926
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:22,083
"The heaven did not change
its mind amidst flowers"

927
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:27,500
"God tried to bribe the
moon but moon did not change."

928
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:32,791
"He gave bribe of heaven
but mind did not change"

929
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:37,583
"God tried to bribe the
moon but moon did not change."

930
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:42,708
"You are always in my
mind and I sit at your feet."

931
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:48,166
"Now will not turn and
bid farewell like a bride."

932
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:56,166
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

933
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,416
"Became disloyal."

934
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:18,000
"You talk very sweetly and even
the extinguished lamp starts burning."

935
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:23,375
"Even the sound of
cuckoo bird feels flat."

936
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:28,750
"You talk very sweetly and even
the extinguished lamp starts burning."

937
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:33,208
"Even the sound of
cuckoo bird feels flat."

938
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:38,541
"I felt it was impossible.
What else do I want?"

939
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:44,625
"The poet recited
his poems at your feet."

940
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:54,541
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

941
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:57,166
"Became disloyal."

942
01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:05,250
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

943
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,750
"Became disloyal."

944
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:15,958
"Because of you moon
became disloyal to God."

945
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:18,958
"Became disloyal."

946
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:41,333
I bought this jacket as
well just like Jimmy Shergill.

947
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:44,916
Wow! You just had total
feel about the movie, Rajveer.

948
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:51,333
Look at this.

949
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:53,500
What is this?

950
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,750
I pasted all the posters here.

951
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:16,208
- What was that?
- Nothing.

952
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:17,291
Tell me.

953
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:18,458
You will laugh a lot.

954
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,208
No, I will not laugh. Show it to me.

955
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:34,416
Don't tell me that this my hair strand?

956
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,541
Are you crazy?

957
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:40,041
School boys do such type of deeds.

958
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,833
The school boy had kept this.

959
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:52,875
Just look at the jacket.

960
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:57,958
When did you feel that
I am different from others?

961
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:00,625
Sports period.

962
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,083
We boys were always busy in playing.

963
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,916
Once I came to drink water

964
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
and saw that girls were
sitting in group and enjoying.

965
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:12,208
I saw you dancing
from corner of the door.

966
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:19,125
And then I used to watch every day.

967
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,666
Did you like my dance so much?

968
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:23,041
No.

969
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:26,041
I mean the dance was also good

970
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,458
but that time you were different.

971
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:35,125
Free, danced like
a peacock in full swing,

972
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:40,416
happy from heart as if you
were not bothered about the world.

973
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:42,708
That moment was so beautiful

974
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,458
that I never blinked my eyes.

975
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:51,666
1, 2, 3...

976
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:57,541
"My beloved...
Keep me as a guard of your heart."

977
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:01,791
"Keep me as a guard of your heart."

978
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,083
I feel like she is an orchestra member.

979
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:14,166
Mother, I wouldn't get someone like her.

980
01:40:14,416 --> 01:40:16,291
Why? What is wrong?

981
01:40:16,708 --> 01:40:21,458
It is good. She will earn.
Your father and son are useless.

982
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:25,416
No, mother no.

983
01:40:26,083 --> 01:40:29,000
Then will you get Dhan Kaur?

984
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:32,208
I think you have gone crazy.

985
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,833
It is difficult to understand you.

986
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,291
Should I thrash you in open or inside?

987
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,875
Your actions are not right.

988
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:44,000
Because of fear you do not go out.

989
01:40:44,166 --> 01:40:46,208
And talks about Sonam Bajwa.

990
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,500
Wasn't Sargun Mehta as a Dhan Kaur?

991
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:51,517
Because of all these things
I am not able to get married.

992
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:59,541
"Keep me as a guard of your heart."

993
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:13,041
Come, I am standing out.

994
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:19,291
Saabi has arrived.

995
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,958
Okay, I shall leave now.

996
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:17,875
Good bye.

997
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,541
Hello.

998
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:10,875
Maninder,

999
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:14,875
I found Rajveer

1000
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,458
Yes, Rajveer is absolutely fine.

1001
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:22,958
He is having fun.
We do not sleep till midnight.

1002
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:25,666
- Look, mother is calling.
- I am saying something else.

1003
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:28,208
What?

1004
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:30,958
I found Rajveer

1005
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:34,000
Okay. How is he?

1006
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:38,791
Can you come to India?

1007
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,291
Hope the marriage
ceremony went off well?

1008
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:17,833
Yes.

1009
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:23,625
They are coming to Vancouver as well.

1010
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:27,333
No, Toronto.

1011
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:32,666
What is the matter?

1012
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:35,958
Do we need to be so formal?

1013
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,666
Look here.

1014
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,750
What is the matter?

1015
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,250
Tell me clearly.

1016
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:49,458
Sorry, Maninder.

1017
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,000
I met Rajveer.

1018
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:53,833
So what?

1019
01:45:54,291 --> 01:45:56,500
This is something good.
Tension relieved.

1020
01:45:56,666 --> 01:45:58,041
Was this the matter?

1021
01:45:58,416 --> 01:45:59,416
Is he fine?

1022
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,958
He is still at the same point

1023
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:09,875
where we got separated.

1024
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:13,541
During school time he
had named his calf in my name.

1025
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:15,708
She has grown up.

1026
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:19,375
He keeps talking to her all day long.

1027
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:25,708
Even today every morning
he punctures the tyre of the cycle

1028
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:27,833
as he did in school times.

1029
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:33,291
Just to go to school in van with me.

1030
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:43,625
I love plants and he
has made plants his life.

1031
01:46:44,083 --> 01:46:46,375
He has opened a nursery in my name.

1032
01:46:47,916 --> 01:46:50,750
Just like a young boy
he has kept our memories.

1033
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:57,791
Actually to be honest
this should not bother me.

1034
01:47:05,416 --> 01:47:07,541
But this is bothering me.

1035
01:47:11,083 --> 01:47:12,208
I am sorry.

1036
01:47:14,375 --> 01:47:16,458
I know this is very wrong.

1037
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:21,208
I will be cursed by
family and society as well.

1038
01:47:21,708 --> 01:47:23,500
But if I keep these feelings within me

1039
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:26,041
then this will be
wrong with both of you.

1040
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:35,250
After meeting him I felt that childhood
love that was suppressed within me.

1041
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:39,250
Please leave me here.

1042
01:47:54,291 --> 01:47:57,125
Should I leave you in water?
Fishes will eat you.

1043
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,875
Serve it to Raunak. She will eat.

1044
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:02,500
The other plant has started
blooming flowers. And you?

1045
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,750
Be a good plant.

1046
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,208
How are you?

1047
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:24,166
I will get coffee.

1048
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:27,750
If you get that spoon in
the mug then I will not spare you.

1049
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,250
Keep that plant with his family.

1050
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,166
Rajveer, I have told my husband

1051
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,865
that I would want to stay here.

1052
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,833
With you in this house.

1053
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:51,333
Are you mad?
This is wrong. This cannot happen.

1054
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,875
Won't you ask what his reply was?

1055
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:59,791
Please leave me here.

1056
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:02,875
No, Raunak?

1057
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:06,625
When you told me for
the first time about him

1058
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:10,291
I had told you that I would
always respect your decisions in life.

1059
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:13,833
And even today I adhere to my words.

1060
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:16,083
I respect your decision.

1061
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:18,375
I have no problem.

1062
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:23,500
We have one life and we should
lead it in pain and sadness.

1063
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:27,458
We got married but you are not my slave.

1064
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:30,666
Let's not get into awkward
situation of going to court.

1065
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:34,125
We need not give
justification to people.

1066
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:36,375
We will mutually decide about it.

1067
01:49:37,416 --> 01:49:41,458
You keep that Rajveer
and I will keep our Rajveer.

1068
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,625
I can understand.

1069
01:49:57,875 --> 01:49:59,625
That it is difficult for a mother.

1070
01:50:03,125 --> 01:50:04,375
Keep him as well.

1071
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:11,083
But just give me permission
to come and meet you both.

1072
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:12,916
Please do not cut off.

1073
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:24,000
I will be single again
with no responsibility.

1074
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,791
Now you have two Rajveer.

1075
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:47,083
To be honest if he did
not allow me to come here

1076
01:50:47,166 --> 01:50:49,006
then I would have fought
with him to come here.

1077
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:54,791
I could not wait for a moment
when he asked to go so easily.

1078
01:50:59,583 --> 01:51:02,666
I was very sad when I got married.

1079
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:07,708
Like you I too wanted to stay back.

1080
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:11,250
My throat choked to take a step further.

1081
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,291
Then my grand-mother
explained me one thing.

1082
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:27,708
When things are not going your way
then think that this is God's decision.

1083
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:30,833
His heart is pure than ours.

1084
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:35,750
He does not do wrong with anyone.

1085
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:39,875
He does what is best for all.

1086
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,333
I won't say that he
love me more than you.

1087
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:17,250
But today he has proved that
he loves me as much as you do.

1088
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:21,041
We got separated because
of a very small misunderstanding.

1089
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:23,791
You could have talked to me.

1090
01:53:23,875 --> 01:53:25,541
Have you ever thought why?

1091
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:28,083
Because God had not written
togetherness in our destiny.

1092
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:35,333
If God wanted us to be together
then He would have done it at that time.

1093
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:41,041
If I can get someone who
loves me so much other than you

1094
01:53:42,583 --> 01:53:45,208
then you can also get
someone other than me.

1095
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:53,750
Do you know what the reason
behind our meeting again is?

1096
01:53:54,458 --> 01:53:56,250
That you move ahead in life.

1097
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:01,458
As far as love is concerned,

1098
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:03,333
no one can take it out from us.

1099
01:54:03,958 --> 01:54:05,666
It was our destiny
that we did not unite.

1100
01:54:06,333 --> 01:54:09,875
I love you and you love me.
This will always remain.

1101
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:13,041
We have not done anything wrong.

1102
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:16,125
And we will always respect this.

1103
01:54:17,166 --> 01:54:21,208
Promise me that you
will move on in life.

1104
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:30,125
I love you, Rajveer Singh.

1105
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:41,791
I love you, Raunak.

1106
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:52,791
She said I love you
and their pair is made.

1107
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:55,083
And you are still roaming single.

1108
01:54:56,666 --> 01:55:01,958
Wasn't Nimrat Khaira in Jodi
and Neeru Bajwa in Shadaa?

1109
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:31,375
"Let's stay in each
other's prayers, dear."

1110

and blaming each other."

"It is important that hearts meet."

1112
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:49,916
"It is not important
that we get our love or not."

1113
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:55,416
"Everything is fine.
There is nothing to fight."

1114

"We may be far but not separated."

1115
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,458
"Love is also to cross the sea of fire."

1116
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:12,500
"It is love to die in someone's memory."

1117
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:18,250
"There is no need to
cry if you do not get love."

1118
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:23,166
"Love is love and an advertisement."

1119

1123
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:15,041
"You do not stop living and breathing.
You do not stop having desires."

1124
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:23,125
"This is life dear and
does not stop for anyone."

1125
01:57:26,125 --> 01:57:31,500
"You will fly with
it wherever it takes you."

1126
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:37,041
"While leaving my soul will tell you..."

1127
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:45,000
"If you are not complete without me"

1128
01:57:45,250 --> 01:57:50,458
"So am I not complete without you."

1129
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:56,291
"It is important that hearts meet."

1130
01:57:56,375 --> 01:58:01,541
